# sublime-lasercraft-landing-page

This page was originally created following course instruction for The Odin Project with the intention of developing it into a full website. This business is very real and owned and operated by my amazing wife and myself. All the pictures are of real products (or mockups) that we have made and we hope you like what we can do.

If you're interested in seeing a lot of our other stuff until I get more added you can see more of our work here:
